# 🐾 Wildlife Image Classification System

This project presents a deep learning-based Wildlife Image Classification system built using TensorFlow/Keras and deployed with Streamlit.

The application allows users to upload animal images and receive real-time predictions from a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

## 📌 Overview

Modern deep learning models have achieved remarkable performance in image classification tasks. However, building an end-to-end deployable system requires more than just model training.

This project focuses on:

- Designing and training a CNN-based wildlife classifier
- Implementing image preprocessing pipelines
- Integrating the trained model into a Streamlit web application
- Deploying the system on Streamlit Community Cloud

The goal is to create a lightweight, accessible, and user-friendly AI application for wildlife species identification.
